# Assignment 2 Writeup

## Creating the Algorithm
For this project, I was tasked with creating a text autocompletion service that utilized the DLB trie ADT. Given a text file, "A2Test.java" will add the words in the file to a DLB trie dictionary. This dictionary can be used to access words incredibly quickly, even though the size of the dictionary could be quite large. For example, when adding "dict8.txt" as the dictionary for the autocompletion program, there are 1182 words that begin with the letter 'a'. However, all these words are accessed letter by letter, and words with similar letters are simply stacked on top of each other. 'Star' and 'Stars' are stored in in same path, so this makes it easy to predict what words might come next. The DLB Trie has a size field to indicate how many words are in a given node's subtree (to count predictions) and an isWord field to say whether the current path is a word ending at the current node!

### Specific Method Purposes
Once I understood the purpose of the DLB and how to set up all the fields, this project was a fun problem to solve! I began with the add(string) method. This one took the most brain power since I was still familiarizing myself with how to implement the DLB. I was back and forth between making the helper method with a boolean or node return type, but found that it worked better in my head with a boolean, so I stuck to that. The first problem I ran into with this method was moving currentNode to a null value, which would lose my spot in the DLB, so I had to implement a temp node to use instead. The other main problem was accounting for all edge cases of the DLB. I can confidently say that, at this point, after drawing probably dozens of DLBs for visualization, the layout of the DLB is burned into my brain.

Once add was completed, I was able to debug it with the provided printTrie methods before moving on to the rest of the project. Reset(), isWord(), getNumberOfPredictions(), and retrievePrediction() were all fairly easy to visualize and didn't take too much effort to write. However, advance() and retreat() both tripped me up a good amount. There are a lot of edge cases to worry about, but understanding a the layout of the DLB made this bearable. Retreat() was made simple by the fact that sibling nodes can only lead to a single parent on the left-most sibling! Advance() will always try to move to the child, but if the end of the sibling list is far away you don't want to traverse all the way down the list and then all the way back up. This is where my biggest issue came in: the offset.

#### The Offset
When a letter is added to the currentPrefix to make it no longer a valid word in the dictionary, a few things need to happen. 1) currentNode can't move up nor down until the current prefix is back to being a valid word. 2)currentNode needs to stay at the last valid letter in case the user wants to retreat to that point, no matter how many invalid letters were placed in the currentPrefix. 3)isWord(), getNumberOfPredictions(), and retrievePrediction() all need to automatically return false, 0, and null respectively if the currentPrefix isn't valid. 4)The currentPrefix and currentNode need to know when they are valid again, so it can't be as simple as checking for a similar parent.
I originally thought this problem could be solved with a boolean variable. This would be false if the current prefix was valid and true if it was invalid. Then, all methods could easily test if they could or could not move up or down. However, this didn't account for repeated letters in words. For example, if the word BEE is in the dictionary, and the current prefix is BEEEE, my original code would reset the boolean to valid, making the current prefix BEEE with the current node pointing to BEE. BEEE wouldn't be in the dictionary, but everything would point to it being a valid word. 
To fix this, I just changed the boolean to an int. It incremented for every invalid letter added and decremented for every invalid letter taken off. Now instead of checking for the correct parent, I just had to see if the offset number was greater than 0. This also mad the secondary add() method a lot easier since that needed to move current node to the end of the new word. Because of the int offset, I could start looking for the new word at the old position of currentNode instead of the root of the DLB, which saves a good amount of time for long words.

## Runtimes
All of my methods were able to meet the target runtimes provided.
- add(string) in all cases is theta(length of word) since it always starts at the root of the DLB. In the worst case this would have to traverse multiple sibling lists, with each sibling list being the length of the alphabet, giving a number of word.length() * alphabet.length(), but since the alphabet length is a constant factor it does not matter asymptotically.
- advance(char) appends a letter in O(1) time. In the worst case, it will have to traverse a sibling list of the entire alphabet, which is asymptotically trivial.
- retreat() deletes a letter in O(1) time. Worst case is the same scenario as advance(char)
- reset() resets all global variables in O(1) time
- add() adds the current prefix to the dictionary in O(word length) time. This method calls the add(string) method, so its runtime is the same as that. In the worst case, it will have to traverse the list to re-assign the currentNode variable in O(currentPrefix.length - wordOffset) time.
- getNumberOfPredictions() returns the size of the current node in O(1) time. This is true for all cases, so its really theta(1).
- retrievePrediction() retrieves the first possible prediction in O(prediction.length() - currentPrefix.length()) time. It starts to search at the currentNode and simply goes straight down until the node's isWord field is true. It never has to look at a sibling.
